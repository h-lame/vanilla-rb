--~::{ Vanilla.rb }::~---
=========================

  A wandering soul; a repo clone'd -
  his meta_klass and methods honed.
  But tarry he 'ponst what dark endeavour
  with code of such unknowable terror?

                              - H.P. Gemcraft, 1914

A Preface; A Warning
====================

The base flavour. The classic ice cream. Except riddled through with blood-red gemstones - Ruby gemstones.
This mad gelato will break your teeth.

... and run the freakiest wiki-wonki-wiki-wonki-wiki-wonki-wickedy-wiki you've ever seen. 

But you must not fear: fear is the mind-killer; fear is the little death that brings total oblivion; 
fear is the chilling terror that makes you believe that *everything* is better when Model lays with 
Controller and View in peace.

Vanilla.rb cries "HERESY!" upon that layered orgy of filth. Vanilla.rb says "EMBRACE CHAOS!". Vanilla.rb
says "EVERY SNIP FOR THEMSELVES!". Vanilla.rb waits quietly, in the dark corners.

Use at your own risk; really. I showed it to a cat, and the cat started talking in French. 
It was MESSED. UP.


Thee Darke Invocation
=====================

$ gem install soup sqlite3-ruby rack

$ rake bootstrap

... a bunch of stuff gets created

$ rackup vanilla/vanilla.ru

... the wonki starts. THE PAIN BEGINS.

[$ gem install sinatra; ruby vanilla/snips_on_sinatra.rb # also kinda works.]


Usage
=====

Currently unknowable; soon I hope to compile such a nercronomicon as to allow mortal kind to
conjure up Snips and Dynasnips and Renderers...
